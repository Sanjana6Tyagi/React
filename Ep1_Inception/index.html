<!-- whatever we are passing from root.render from app.js it is replacing what is there inside the root that means  
     This h1 tag will be replaced by the parent.
     We also saw if there is something above and below the root you can still use react in the small portion of the page that means just in the id root-->

<!-- React is just a library , It is a small js library which you can import like a js file in your code 
     and it will give you superpowers , you can use React in your existing project no matter they are using jquery or next js etc
     so thats how powerful react is and it is a lirary not a framework
     A framework comes with a lot of baggage with it whereas react does not come up   
     If react is a library and it is small can we make large scale app from it? yes we can make-->
